<h2>ASP.NET Document Viewer for Your Website</h2>
With this add-on, you can seamlessly integrate <a href="http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library" target="_blank">GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET</a> into your SilverStripe website. It’s an HTML5-based document viewer designed to be easy to integrate into any ASP.NET website or app. The viewer allows you to display over 50 types of documents and images on any page within your website. Supported file formats include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, OpenDocument formats, Visio diagrams, CAD drawings and raster images.

<strong>Native Text Rendering</strong>
GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET provides two rendering modes – documents can be either rasterized, or converted to pure HTML, CSS and SVG. When rasterizing, the viewer extracts the text from documents and displays it in a separate layer on top of background images.

Both modes provide native text rendering, meaning users can select and copy text to the clipboard right from documents embedded to a web-page. This also ensures fonts look sharp even when zooming in/out of a document.

<strong>Web UI</strong>
GroupDocs.Viewer comes with a web UI that lets your website visitors seamlessly view and navigate multipage documents in a browser. In particular, users can turn document pages like slides, preview/navigate them with thumbnails or jump straight to a specified page; search for text within the document using keywords; zoom in/out of a document; print and download embedded documents form browser, etc.

<strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>
Users can view documents from any modern browser without having to install any 3rd party software or plugins. Supported browsers include: IE8+, Chrome, FireFox, Opera, Safari 5+ and their mobile versions.

<h3>Installing the Viewer</h3>
Before you proceed, please be aware that this add-on requires the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library to be installed on your server first. If you don’t have a license for the viewer yet, please feel free to download an evaluation copy of the library from the <a href="http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library" target="_blank">GroupDocs website</a>.
